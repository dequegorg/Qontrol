--- VERSION ---
11.09.06.15.18 ALPHA

--- HELP ---
There is no setup yet, so you have to install dependencies yourself.
Required modules are:
    * PyQt4
    * Xlib

Run:
sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-xlib

Copy all content of ./src on eg. ~/Desktop
Run python ./qontrol.py
Click on the panel buttons to show or hide the dashboard.
There is currently no content to the dashboard or panel.
You can change the orientation of the dashboard in the ~/.qontrol/cnf/user.cnf file, you can set the value to "south", "north", "west" or "east".
Then restart Qontrol for configuration changes to take effect.

Thanks for testing.

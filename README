--- VERSION ---
11.11.04.23.40 ALPHA

--- HELP ---
There is no setup file yet.
Copy all content of ./src on eg. ~/Desktop
Run python ./qontrol.py
Scroll up and down on panel to show or hide the dashboard.
There is currently no content to the dashboard or panel.
You can change the orientation of the dashboard in the ~/.qontrol/cnf/user.cnf file, you can set the value to "south", "north", "west" or "east".
Then restart Qontrol for configuration changes to take effect.

Thanks for testing.
